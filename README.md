<h1 align="center">GRANTS</h1>

<p align="center">These are the initiatives supported by General Fund donations, these grants are intended to be long-term support initiatives with continued funding, not touch-and-go projects. 100% of donations made go to support the people working on these initiatives through grants.</p> 

<p align="center">Combined, these grants break the entire Bitcoin mining stack free from its closed-source shackles. Starting with a standardized ~100W hashboard, the Ember One, this multi-chip hashboard lays the ground work for more powerful mining systems built with a range of ASICs from different manufacturers. Next, we added a versatile control board, the Libre Board, that can run a full Bitcoin node, communicate with a range of sensors and relays, and offers the end-user the ability to customize the compute module. Then to get the hardware components communicating with each other, we developed the mission-driven firmware, Mujina, which interfaces with the hashboards, the mining pool, the user interface, and the on-board diagnostics of the mining system. Finally, to bring it full circle, we are including a one-click deployable mining pool called Hydra Pool which features solo mining mode and PPLNS share accounting and pay out. The future is open-source.</p>

<h1 align="center">COMING SOON: BITAXE & OSMU</h1>

<p align="center">The 256 Foundation is planning on teaming up with OSMU and making <a href="https://bitaxe.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><font color="orange">Bitaxe</font></a> an official project supported through the foundation's grant programs. Watch for announcements and details soon on <a href="https://x.com/256foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><font color="orange">Twitter</font></a>. The Open Source Miners United is a community of enthusiasts, developers, and engineers who connect on Discord to support open-source Bitcoin mining development. There are many resources and rich discussions available from the many active members. 100% of donations made to the OSMU Fund go to support open-source Bitcoin mining developers, maintaining and managing the Discord server, bug bounties, legal matters, and other community support efforts. If you are interested in learning, sharing ideas, and participating, you can join the Discord server <a href="https://discord.com/invite/osmu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><font color="orange">here</font></a>.</p>
